- One extreme solution:

- Farmer pays a fixed fee up front, once paid, the farmer keeps all surplus

- Would have to be high enough to be worthwhile to the landlord

- Problems with this solution:
  1. requires high upfront cost to farmer (often poor, capital-constrained)
  2. imposes the entirety of the risk on the farmer (bad harvest, weather, invasion, theft)

- New .hi-purple[principle-agent problems] introduced:

1. Farmer has an incentive to *underreport* to landlord how much surplus they produce, effectively "stealing" more than their share
  - landowner must monitor farmer to reduce this possibility (and this is costly)

2. Farmer is effectively taxed (50%, in this example) on their output
  - has 50% less incentive to be productive than if they were 100% residual claimant
  - farmer will exert less effort since they get less of the output

&gt; “A good part of the .hi[politics of measurement] sprang from what a contemporary economist might call .hi[the "stickiness" of feudal rents.] Noble and clerical claimants often found it .hi[difficult to increase feudal dues directly]; the levels set for various charges were the .hi[result of long struggle,] and even a small increase above the customary level was viewed as a .hi[threatening breach of tradition.] Adjusting the measure, however, represented a roundabout way of achieving the same end.”

&gt; “The local lord might, for example, lend grain to peasants in smaller baskets and insist on repayment in larger baskets. He might surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the grain sacks accepted for milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of the sacks used for measuring out flour; he might also collect feudal dues in larger baskets and pay wages in kind in smaller baskets. While the formal custom governing feudal dues and wages would thus remain intact (requiring, for example, the same number of sacks of wheat from the harvest of a given holding), the actual transaction might increasingly favor the lord. The results of such fiddling were far from trivial. Kula estimates that the size of the bushel (boisseau) used to collect the main feudal rent (taille) increased by one-third between 1674 and 1716 as part of what was called the reaction feodale.”

&gt; "We argue that the effect of economic change on political power is a key factor in determining whether technological advances and beneficial economic changes will be blocked. In other words, we propose a "political-loser hypothesis." We argue that it is groups whose political power (not economic rents) is eroded who will block technological advances. If agents are economic losers but have no political power, they cannot impede technological progress. If they have and maintain political power (i.e., are not political losers), then they have no incentive to block progress. It is therefore agents who have political power and fear losing it who will have incentives to block. Our analysis suggests that we should look more to the nature of political institutions and the determinants of the distribution of political power if we want to understand technological backwardness," (pp.126-127).

By granting them magistrates of their own, the privilege of making bye-laws for their own government, that of building walls for their own defence, and that of reducing all their inhabitants under a sort of military discipline, he gave them all the means of security and independency of the barons which it was in his power to bestow. Without the establishment of some regular government of this kind, without some authority to compel their inhabitants to act according to some certain plan or system, no voluntary league of mutual defence could either have afforded them any permanent security, or have enabled them to give the king any considerable support," (Book III, Chapter III).

&gt; "In countries such as France or England, where the authority of the sovereign, though frequently very low, never was destroyed altogether, the cities had no opportunity of becoming entirely independent. They became, however, so considerable that the sovereign could impose no tax upon them, besides the stated farm-rent of the town, without their own consent. They were, therefore, called upon to send deputies to the general assembly of the states of the kingdom, where they might join with the clergy and the barons in granting, upon urgent occasions, some extraordinary aid to the king. Being generally, too, more favourable to his power, their deputies seem, sometimes, to have been employed by him as a counter-balance in those assemblies to the authority of the great lords. Hence the origin of the representation of burghs in the states-general of all the great monarchies in Europe," (Book III, Chapter III).

# War and State Capacity: Summary I

&gt; "Understanding economic history is critical for comprehending the importance of state capacity. **In historical terms, the emergence of well functioning states is a relatively recent phenomenon.** For many premodern polities, even **the term state is an anachronism: there was no state in much of Europe prior to the late middle ages.** Otto Heinze observed that feudal rulers ‘lacked the attributes of sovereignty—that is, independence beyond its borders and exclusive rights within them’ (Hintze, 1906, 1975, p. 192). In medieval Europe, characterized by fragmented political authority, overlapping and competing legal jurisdictions, and private armies—the modern concept of a state—has little empirical purchase (Strayer, 1970). **The word 'state' only came to acquire its modern meaning in English at the end of the sixteenth century** (Skinner, 2009). This was not merely a semantic change; when 'the word 'state', l'etat, stato' or Der Staat came into usage in the early modern period **it was 'a word for a new political experience'** (Oakeshott, 2006, p. 361)," (p.2).

# War and State Capacity: Summary II

&gt; "Perhaps the most important function of the state is to provide defense. Frequently this is defense against aggression by other states. Premodern polities were often at war. In the early modern period, particularly bellicose states like Russia and France were at war more often than they were at peace (Voigtlander and Voth, 2013). **Warfare was economically costly, typically involving the devastation of agriculture land**—as in the chevauchée of the Hundred Years War, for example—and often the destruction of towns and cities that resisted a siege. It seems likely that **the ability of early modern states after 1700 to establish territorial borders and limit the destructiveness of warfare played an important role in allowing Smithian economic growth to take place**," (pp.8-9).

&gt; "The rise of Western Europe after 1500 is due largely to growth in countries with access to the Atlantic Ocean and with substantial trade with the New World, Africa, and Asia via the Atlantic. This trade and the associated colonialism affected Europe not only directly, but also indirectly by inducing institutional change. Where “initial” political institutions (those established before 1500) placed significant checks on the monarchy, the growth of Atlantic trade strengthened merchant groups by constraining the power of the monarchy, and helped merchants obtain changes in institutions to protect property rights. These changes were central to subsequent economic growth," (p.546)
