"Differences among countries can be attributed to differences in human capital, physical capital, and productivity...**Different capital intensities** in the two countries **contributed a factor of 1.5** to the income differences, while **different levels of educational attainment contributed a factor of 3.1**.

"Our hypothesis is that differences in capital accumulation, productivity, and therefore output per worker are **fundamentally related to differences in social infrastructure across countries**. By social infrastructure we mean the **institutions and government policies that determine the economic environment** within which individuals accumulate skills, and firms accumulate capital and produce output," (p. 84).

> "**Growth in this model is driven by technological change** that arises **from intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents**. The distinguishing feature of the **technology** as an input is that it is neither a conventional good nor a public good; it **is a non-rival, partially excludable good.** Because of the nonconvexity introduced by a nonrival good, **price-taking competition cannot be supported.** Instead, the **equilibrium is one with monopolistic competition.**

> "The main conclusions are that the **stock of human capital determines the rate of growth,** that** too little human capital is devoted to research in equilibrium**, that **integration into world markets will increase growth rates**, and that **having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth,**" (pp.S71).

- We'll explore the *features* of Romer's model, equations and graphs are far too complicated<sup>.magenta[1]</sup>

- Romer's model builds on 30 years of macro models since Solow (1956):

]

# Macro Models In the 30 Years Since Solow (1956)

- **Ramsey-Kass-Koopmans model** (1965): Solow model with .hi-purple[microfoundations]!
  - Savings rate $s$ is endogenized: 
  - "infinitely-lived" utility-maximizing individuals decide to supply labor and rent capital to cost-minimizing firms in order to earn income, which they can consume and save for future periods
  - single steady state equilibrium
  - groundwork for all modern macro dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models

--

- **Overlapping Generations (Diamond) model** (1965):
  - Individuals live for 2 periods only (work and retire), determine the savings rate
  - Multiple steady state equilibria possible
  - Economy subject to dynamic inefficiency

---

# The Motivations for Romer

- Problems with how Solow models the aggregate economy:

1. "Knowledge" (TFP) has a non-rival component to it

2. Markets/aggregate production function cannot possibly be competitive and constant returns to scale
    - Market power/monopolistic competition
    - Increasing returns to scale

3. Knowledge does not grow exogenously, but is the result of market forces and optimizing choices: people and firms face incentives to create and exploit it (or not)

Such men must be remunerated for their literary labour...It is desirable that we should have a supply of good books; we cannot have such a supply unless men of letters are liberally remunerated, and the least objectionable way of remunerating them is by means of copyright...The system of copyright has great advantages, and great disadvantages...Copyright is monopoly, and produces all the effects which the general voice of mankind attributes to monopoly...Monopoly is an evil...For the sake of the good we must submit to the evil; but the evil ought not to last a day longer than is necessary for the purpose of securing the good..."

Yet it is still the case that private, profit-maximizing agents make investments in the creation of new knowledge and that they earn a return on these investments by charging a price for the resulting goods that is greater than the marginal cost of producing the goods," (p.S90).

# Romer Model: Assumptions I

.pull-left[

- Population (or labor supply) and the total stock of human capital in the population are fixed $(\bar{L}, \bar{H})$

- Four factors of production:

1. Labor $L$
2. Physical capital $K$
  - a stock of "machines" that can be accumulated
  - diminishing returns
3. Human capital $H$
  - rivalrous, embodied in $L$ and $K$
4. Technology $A$
  - nonrival, exists beyond individuals, grow indefinitely
  - a stock, like $K$, that can be accumulated
  - no restrictions on returns!
  - measured as countable "new designs" for capital

# Romer Model: Assumptions II

- The economy has three sectors:

1. **Research sector**
    - Uses inputs $H$ and the existing stock of knowledge $A_{t-1}$ to produce new knowledge, $A_t$
    - Measured in "new designs" for capital $K$

--

2. **Intermediate goods sector**
    - Takes inputs $H$ and $A_t$ to produce $K$ for use in final goods sector

--

3. **Final goods sector**
    - uses $L$, $H$, and $K$ to produce final output $Y$

--

- Output can be consumed, or saved (to be used to make new capital, $K)$:
    $$Y_t=C_t+S_t$$

- Fixed supply of human capital is allocated to research sector or manufacturing based on relative manufacturing wages and return to new designs
$$\bar{H}=H_A+H_Y$$

---

# The Nature of "Knowledge" I

.pull-left[
- Knowledge $(A)$ is a stock that can be accumulated, like physical capital $(K)$

- To produce new knowledge, you need to use the existing stock of knowledge
    - i.e. need the idea of gravity to get relativity, we need both to get quantum mechanics, etc.

- In the model's equilibrium (p.S88):

1. Consumers decide between $C$ and $S$ based on interest rate $r$

2. Holders of $H$ decide whether to work in Research sector $(H_A)$ or in Manufacturing $(H_Y)$ based on existing stock of knowledge $A$, price of designs, and wages in manufacturing

3. Final goods producers choose cost-minimizing inputs of $L$, $H$, and $K$

4. Each firm owning $A$ (designs) sets prices to maximize profit given interest rate and market demand curves in final product market

5. Potential entrants to market consider price of designs in entry decision

6. Supply equals demand for each good

# Romer Model: Growth Rate

- As in full Solow model, growth rate of output per worker $\frac{Y}{L}$ is the growth rate of knowledge $(A)$, i.e. $g$

- Main problem with Solow (exogenous) growth model(s): $g$ is assumed as a constant number

- Romer *endogenizes* $g$, sp how does it grow?

--

$$g=\frac{\delta H - \Lambda \rho}{\sigma \Lambda + 1}$$

- $\Lambda = \frac{\alpha}{(1-\alpha-\beta)(\alpha+\beta)}$<sup>.magenta[1]</sup>
- $\delta$: a productivity parameter (of $H)$
- $\rho$: discount rate (from Ramsey-Kass-Koopmans model)
- $\sigma$: growth rate of utility (from Ramsey-Kass-Koopmans model)

.footnote[<sup>.magenta[1]</sup> `\\(\alpha\\)` and `\\(\beta\\)` are exponents from Cobb-Douglas production function: `\\(Y=H^\alpha L^\beta K^{1-\alpha-\beta}\\)`]

# Romer Model Implication I - R&D Is Critical

- Economies tend to undersupply human capital to research:

> The most obvious reason is that research has positive external effects. An additional design raises the productivity of all future individuals who do research, but because this benefit is nonexcludable, it is not reflected at all in the market price for designs. The second and an equally important reason...is that research produces an input that is purchased by a sector that engages in monopoly pricing. The markup of price over marginal cost forces a wedge between the marginal social product of an input used in this sector and its market compensation," (p.S96)

--

- Policy implications:

> "Within the confines of the model, the social optimum can be achieved by subsidizing the accumulation of A," (p.S97)

> "A subsidy to physical capital accumulation may be a very poor substitute for direct subsidies that increase the incentive to undertake research. In the absence of feasible policies that can remove the divergence between the social and private returns to research, a second-best policy would be to subsidize the accumulation of total human capital," (p.S99)

---

# Romer Model Implication II - Trade Liberalization

- A large population is *not* sufficient for greater technology (and thus, economic growth), it requires access to a *larger market* (division of labor)!

> If access to a large number of workers or consumers were all that mattered, having a large population would be a good substitute for trade with other nations. The model here suggests that what is important for growth is integration not into an economy with a large number of people but rather into one with a large amount of human capital, (p.S98)

> "The most interesting positive implication of the model is that an economy with a larger total stock of human capital will experience faster growth. This finding suggests that free international trade can act to speed up growth. It also suggests a way to understand what it is about developed economies in the twentieth century that permitted rates of growth of income per capita that are unprecedented in human history. The model also suggests that low levels of human capital may help explain why growth is not observed in underdeveloped economies that are closed and why a less developed economy with a very large population can still benefit from economic integration with the rest of the world," (p.S99)

# One Test of the Model: "Market Access" Literature

- Sokoloff (1988): counties in the U.S. in the 19<sup>th</sup> century that had access to navigable waterways had higher rates of patenting (proxy for innovation, adding to $A)$ than those that did not
    - Even clearer: counties that *gained* access to new waterway (i.e. a new canal) saw sharp increase in patenting!
