> "Mutual interest, therefore, disposed [the burghers] to support the king, and the king to support them against the lords. They were the enemies of his enemies, and it was his interest to render them as secure and independent of those enemies as he could. By granting them magistrates of their own, the privilege of making bye-laws for their own government, that of building walls for their own defence, and that of reducing all their inhabitants under a sort of military discipline, he gave them all the means of security and independency of the barons which it was in his power to bestow. Without the establishment of some regular government of this kind, without some authority to compel their inhabitants to act according to some certain plan or system, no voluntary league of mutual defence could either have afforded them any permanent security, or have enabled them to give the king any considerable support," (Book III, Chapter III).

> "In countries such as France or England, where the authority of the sovereign, though frequently very low, never was destroyed altogether, the cities had no opportunity of becoming entirely independent. They became, however, so considerable that the sovereign could impose no tax upon them, besides the stated farm-rent of the town, without their own consent. They were, therefore, called upon to send deputies to the general assembly of the states of the kingdom, where they might join with the clergy and the barons in granting, upon urgent occasions, some extraordinary aid to the king. Being generally, too, more favourable to his power, their deputies seem, sometimes, to have been employed by him as a counter-balance in those assemblies to the authority of the great lords. Hence the origin of the representation of burghs in the states-general of all the great monarchies in Europe," (Book III, Chapter III).

# War and State Capacity: Summary I

.smaller[
> "Understanding economic history is critical for comprehending the importance of state capacity. **In historical terms, the emergence of well functioning states is a relatively recent phenomenon.** For many premodern polities, even **the term state is an anachronism: there was no state in much of Europe prior to the late middle ages.** Otto Heinze observed that feudal rulers ‘lacked the attributes of sovereignty—that is, independence beyond its borders and exclusive rights within them’ (Hintze, 1906, 1975, p. 192). In medieval Europe, characterized by fragmented political authority, overlapping and competing legal jurisdictions, and private armies—the modern concept of a state—has little empirical purchase (Strayer, 1970). **The word 'state' only came to acquire its modern meaning in English at the end of the sixteenth century** (Skinner, 2009). This was not merely a semantic change; when 'the word 'state', l'etat, stato' or Der Staat came into usage in the early modern period **it was 'a word for a new political experience'** (Oakeshott, 2006, p. 361)," (p.2).

# War and State Capacity: Summary II

> "Perhaps the most important function of the state is to provide defense. Frequently this is defense against aggression by other states. Premodern polities were often at war. In the early modern period, particularly bellicose states like Russia and France were at war more often than they were at peace (Voigtlander and Voth, 2013). **Warfare was economically costly, typically involving the devastation of agriculture land**—as in the chevauchée of the Hundred Years War, for example—and often the destruction of towns and cities that resisted a siege. It seems likely that **the ability of early modern states after 1700 to establish territorial borders and limit the destructiveness of warfare played an important role in allowing Smithian economic growth to take place**," (pp.8-9).

> "The rise of Western Europe after 1500 is due largely to growth in countries with access to the Atlantic Ocean and with substantial trade with the New World, Africa, and Asia via the Atlantic. This trade and the associated colonialism affected Europe not only directly, but also indirectly by inducing institutional change. Where “initial” political institutions (those established before 1500) placed significant checks on the monarchy, the growth of Atlantic trade strengthened merchant groups by constraining the power of the monarchy, and helped merchants obtain changes in institutions to protect property rights. These changes were central to subsequent economic growth," (p.546)

Both suppositions are false. A trade which is forced by means of bounties and monopolies may be and commonly is disadvantageous to the country in whose favour it is meant to be established, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter.
