- At first glance, `\(C\)` just has to make a better offer than `\(L\)`
  - Provide more private goods to `\(W\)` than the Leader!

- But challenger faces a .hi[commitment problem]
  - Current `\(W\)` members obtain private rents because they are in `\(W\)`
  - If `\(C\)` comes to power, members of `\(W\)` continue to earn rents *only if they are still in* `\(W\)` under `\(C\)`'s leadership!
  - `\(C\)` can promise a member `\(W_i\)` that they will be in the new `\(W\)` under `\(C\)`, but this promise is not *credible!*

.pull-right[

- Why doesn't `\(L\)` face the same commitment problem?

- Current `\(W\)` members recognize they keep getting rents only so long as they remain loyal to `\(L\)`

- Winning coalitions are stable over time because `\(W_i\)` members have greater confidence that they will be in `\(W\)` and earn rents into the future under `\(L\)`, unlike the uncertainty with `\(C\)`

- So `\(L\)` and `\(C\)` make competing offers to members of `\(W\)`, and `\(W\)` chooses the candidate with the best (in expected value terms) offer

- Choice to defect for `\(W_i\)` depends on two key factors:

1. .hi-purple[The size of the winning coalition, `\\(W\\)`]

2. .hi-purple[The loyalty norm, `\\(\frac{W}{S}\\)`]

- .hi-purple[The probability of being in a leader's winning coalition is `\\(\frac{W}{S}\\)`]

- Intuition: if enough members of `\(W\)` *defect* and `\(C\)` wins, forms a new regime
  - Draws `\(W \in S\)` selectorate to form new coalition
  - Since `\(W&lt;S\)`, defectors (currently in `\(W)\)` can’t be certain they’ll be in *new* `\(W\)`
    - many inessential defectors won’t be part of new regime

- So a potential defector in `\(W\)` faces a tradeoff:
  - (Expected) .hi-green[marginal benefit of defecting]: being in `\(W\)` under `\(C\)`
  - (Expected) .hi-red[marginal cost of defecting]: in `\(W\)` now under `\(L\)`, but not being in `\(W\)` under `\(C\)`

- As `\(W \uparrow\)` or `\(\downarrow S\)`, `\(C\)` is less likely to need any particular member `\(W_i\)` (and less likely to include them in new regime)
  - Defecting becomes riskier&lt;sup&gt;.magenta[†]&lt;/sup&gt;

- Risk of *not* being in `\(W\)` is `\((1-\frac{W}{S})\)`

In these circumstances [after the rebellion on An Lu-Shan from 756 to 763 AD] the emperors could look for loyal service to one source and one alone - their eunuchs. For eunuchs were absolutely and unconditionally loyal to the emperors. This indeed is true, not only for the Chinese Empire, but for all the others that used the services of eunuchs - Persia, late Rome, Byzantium. Eunuchs had neither lands nor fortunes nor families to fall back upon. To the generals they were half-men, to the mandarines guttersnipes with neither the breeding nor the education of a gentleman. The Emperor, therefore was their sole support and they lived or died, rose or fell, entirely by his favor," (pp. 66-67).

# Leadership Turnover and Succession I

.pull-left[

- In autocracies, new autocrats need to establish their patronage network and convince `\(W\)` that they will deliver the private rents
  - High risk of challengers overthrowing early in regime

- If leader survives for first 1-2 years in office, very high probability leader will continue until they die in their sleep
  - Until/unless it's learned that ruler has a terminal disease

# Leadership Turnover and Succession III

.pull-left[

- Hereditary monarchy is a popular solution to the **problem of succession**

- Even then, sometimes multiple legitimate heirs to throne

- Need the backing of multiple barons `\((W)\)` and/or kill rivals!

# The Violence Trap

# The Frequency of National Violence

&gt; "First, violent regime change is common. **Ten percent of all regimes last no more than one
year, while half of all regimes last no more than eight years.** Three-quarters of the countries in the "all regimes" sample last no more than a generation (here, 24 years). Finally, **only ten percent of regimes last fifty years or more, less than an average human lifetime.**"

&gt; "Second, the richest developing countries are more like poor developing countries than they are like the developed world. Among developing countries with below-median incomes, fifty percent of regimes last only 7 years. In countries ranking between the 75th and 90th percentiles of income—the developing world elite—the corresponding figureis 12.5. Finally, for the developed world (the richest decile of countries), the figure is 60. Thus, the richest developing countries move only 10% of the total distance between the third and first worlds in median duration."
