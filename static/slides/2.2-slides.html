&gt; "Which of the systems is likely to be more efficient...depends on whether we are more likely to succeed in putting at the disposal of a single central authority all the knowledge which ought to be used but which is initially dispersed among many different individuals, or in conveying to the individuals such additional knowledge as they need in order to enable them to fit their plans with those of others," (pp.519-520).

&gt; "The problem arises because one of the most important forces which in a truly competitive economy brings about the reduction of costs to the minimum discoverable will be absent, namely, price competition...[T]he question is frequently treated as if the cost curves were objectively given facts. What is forgotten is that the method which under given conditions is the cheapest is a thing which has to be discovered, and to be discovered anew, sometimes almost from day to day, by the entrepreneur, and that, in spite of the strong inducement, it is by no means regularly the established entrepreneur, the man in charge of the existing plant, who will discover what is the best method," (p.196).

&gt; "The force which in a competitive society brings about the reduction of price to the lowest cost...is the opportunity for anybody who knows a cheaper method to come in at his own risk and to attract customers by underbidding the existing producers. But, if prices are fixed by the authority, this method is excluded," (p.196).

# Mises-Hayek View of Prices

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Prices are knowledge surrogates in dynamic disequilibrium]

- **Efficiency of prices**: use distributed knowledge and incentivize local actors to exploit opportunities, which reduce error and bring about greater social coordination

- **Prices are never "given"**, prices **emerge** dynamically from negotiation and market decisions of entrepreneurs and consumers

- **Competition**: is a **discovery process** which *discovers* what consumer preferences are and what technologies are lowest cost, and how to allocate resources accordingly

&gt; "Today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific knowledge is not the sum of all knowledge. But a little reflection will show that there is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation," (pp.521-522).

# The Socialist Calculation Debate In Retrospect III

.pull-left[
.quitesmall[
- Main disagreement is about **rivalry**

- **Marxists**: .hi-purple[rivalry as inherent flaw] in capitalism leading to conflict; central planning removes rivalry and leads to pre-coordinated harmony

- **Mises-Hayek**: .hi-purple[rivalry] under specific institutions (market prices, property rights) .hi-purple[is the only way to generate the information] necessary to rationally allocate resources

- **Neoclassical economists**: .hi-purple[assume rivalry away] in perfect competition models, viewing prices as just parametric statistics, allowing a central planner to achieve the same optimal outcome
