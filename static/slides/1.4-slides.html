# Two Fundamental Problems of Political Economy

- All societies face two fundamental problems, which institutions emerge (or are created) to address:

&gt; The view that now pervades much public policy economics implicitly presents the relevant choice as between an ideal norm and an existing 'imperfect' institutional arrangement. This **nirvana approach** differs considerably from a comparative institution approach in which the relevant choice is between alternative real institutional arrangements, (p.1).

&gt; "The **first gives us a sense of unlimited power to realize our wishes, while the second leads to the insight that there are limitations to what we can deliberately bring about, and to the recognition that some of our present hopes are delusions.** Yet the effect of allowing ourselves to be deluded by the first view has always been that man has actually limited the scope of what he can achieve. For it has always been the recognition of the limits of the possible which has enabled man to make full use of his powers..." (pp.19-20)

For it is the other way around: our reason is as much the result of an evolutionary selection process as is our morality...the evolution of the extended order...is ...beyond instinct and often opposed to it, and which is...incapable of being created or designed by reason," (p. 21).

Yet if we were always to apply the rules of the extended order to our more intimate groupings, *we would crush them*. **So we must learn to live in two sorts of worlds at once**," (p.18)

&gt; "The dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e. the organization of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the purpose of suppressing the oppressors, cannot result merely in an expansion of democracy. Simultaneously, with an immense expansion of democracy, which, for the first time, becomes democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not democracy for the money-bags, the dictatorship of the proletariat imposes a series of restrictions on the freedom of the oppressors, the exploiters, the capitalists. We must suppress them in order to free humanity from wage slavery,their resistance must be crushed by force; it is clear that there is no freedom and no democracy where there is suppression and where there is violence," (pp.62-65).
