There's all the difference in the world between the two. Yes, many of our men have grown rich in politics. I have myself. I've made a big fortune out of the game, and I'm gettin' richer every day, but I've not gone in for dishonest graft—blackmailin' gamblers, saloonkeepers, disorderly people, etc.—and neither has any of the men who have made big fortunes in politics.

- .hi-purple[Relative Difference]: the difference expressed **in terms of the original value**
$$\frac{\Delta t}{t_1} = \frac{t_2-t_1}{t_1}$$
 this becomes a proportion (a decimal)

> The list of scarce items is practically endless. They are not permanently out of stock, but their appearance is unpredictable...Leningrad can be overstocked with cross-country skis and yet go several months without soap for washing dishes. In the Armenian capital of Yerevan, I found an ample supply of accordians but local people complained that they had gone for weeks without ordinary kitchen spoons or tea samovars. I knew a Moscow family that spent a frantic month hunting for a child’s potty while radios were a glut on the market...

# Limitations of GDP: Compared to What?

.pull-left[

- Again, GDP is a flawed measure

- But remember, economists always ask, "compared to what?"

- You will see later on that variation in GDP between countries and over time strongly explain variation in other measures we care about
