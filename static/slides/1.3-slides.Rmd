> “Insofar as development is concerned with the achievement of a better life, the focus of development analysis has to include the nature of the life that people succeed in living. This incorporates, of course, the length of the life itself, and thus life expectancy data have an immediate relevance to the living standard and through that to the concept of development...People value their ability to do certain things and to achieve certain types of beings (such as being well nourished, being free from avoidable morbidity, being able to move about as desired, and so on). These "doings" and "beings" may be generically called "functionings" of a person,” (p.15).

# Capabilities, Freedom, and GDP per Capita I

> "We do not disagree with either Nussbaum or Sen on the shortcomings of the preoccupation with per capita GDP calculations. However, we believe there is a general pattern to be found between the adoption of the institutions that promote the wealth of a nation and the health and well-being of its people. In other words, life expectancy, infant mortality, educational opportunities, and health outcomes are well correlated with GDP" (p.110).

# Capabilities, Freedom, and GDP per Capita II 

> "Our first conjecture is that the rule of law is a significant factor in explaining economic development. This is hardly controversial...Our second conjecture is that economic development is a significant factor in determining increases in what Sen entitles human capabilities... (p.111).

> "In short, we expect that the rule of law will increase the level of de- velopment, and the level of development will lead to improvements in human capabilities. That is, the rule of law is an institutional fea- ture that promotes economic development that, in turn, leads to in- creases in those capabilities that Nussbaum and Sen argue are neces- sary for living a human life. Economic development, in short, provides the material pre-requisites that enable human flourishing," (p.112).

# Basic Human Needs Approach

Gordon's proposed poverty threshold is defined as **2 or more deprivations** of:

- **Food deprivation**: Body mass index less than 18.5
- **Water deprivation**:access only to unimproved source such as open wells, open springs or surface water or who have to walk for more than 15 minutes to their water source (30 minutes round-trip)
- **Deprivation of sanitation facilities**: access only to unimproved sanitation facilities
- **Health deprivation**: Treatment not recieved for pregnancy, serious illnesses, no knowledge of safe sex practices (esp. HIV/AIDS)
- **Shelter deprivation**: living in dwellings with 3 or more people per room (overcrowding) or in a house with no flooring (e.g. a mud floor) or inadequate roofing (e.g. natural roofing materials)
- **Education deprivation**: youth who did not complete primary school or who are illiterate
- **Information deprivation**: no access to a radio or television (i.e. broadcast media) at home
