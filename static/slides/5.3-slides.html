# North, Wallis, Weingast's Doorstep Conditions

.pull-left[

- How can we get from natural states that benefit the elite to open access orders (that might harm elites?)

- We saw plausible stories about how **feudal societies** transitioned to **mercantilist societies**
  - mercantilist societies are still natural states/limited access orders
  
- How did some countries transition further to .hi-purple[open-access orders] or .hi-purple[liberal democracies]?

- .hi-purple[Again, it must be in the interest of the elite to reform]

# North, Wallis, Weingast's Doorstep Conditions

.pull-left[
- North, Wallis, and Weingast (NWW) have three .hi["Doorstep Conditions"] to reach the *possibility* (not guarantee!) of attaining an Open Access Order:

1. Rule of law for elites

2. Perpetually-lived organizations (public and private) for the elite, including the State itself

3. Consolidation of military control under civilian leadership

- In a **natural state**, rule of law is *impossible*, law and politics is *personal*, *partial*, *patronage* network

- Elites have privileges and rents (lands, titles, etc) based on the price of their loyalty (ability to rebel or threaten violence)

- Equilibrium: dominant coalition of elites respects one another's privileges in proportion to their power

- Dynamic: as relative power distribution changes, privileges are added or revoked to groups that gain/lose power

- Elites must be able to **coordinate a response** against infringers (often the King)

&gt; "[Repealing the Corn laws would solve four problems.] First, it would guarantee the prosperity of the manufacturer by affording him outlets for his products. Second, it would relieve the Condition of England question by cheapening the price of food and ensuring more regular employment. Third, it would make English agriculture more efficient by stimulating demand for its products in urban and industrial areas. Fourth, it would introduce through mutually advantageous international trade a new era of international fellowship and peace. The only barrier to these four beneficent solutions was the ignorant self-interest of the landlords, the "bread-taxing oligarchy, unprincipled, unfeeling, rapacious and plundering."
