<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>We finally begin discussing institutions and their role in economic development. First, we discuss some motivating problems of <em>political economy</em>, the knowledge problem &amp; incentive problem, that different societies try to solve with various institutions. We discuss some of the more specific political-economic problem that must be addressed: that self-interested people will find ways to benefit themselves, even if it comes at the expense of others. What we would <em>like</em> is to create institutions and rules that channel that fundamental motivation into <em>productive</em> outcomes that benefit society, rather than outcomes that only benefit the person, and are <em>unproductive</em> or <em>destructive</em> towards society. In doing so, we contrast profit-seeking with rent-seeking, the latter of which can cause unproductive and destructive outcomes.</p>

<h2>Required Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Chapter 3 in Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012, <em>Why Nations Fail</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 3 outlines the central thesis of the book: that differences in income per capita around the world today, and the trajectories of economic development are determined by political and economic institutions. AJR<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> distinguish between “inclusive institutions” and “extractive institutions,” and describe how the distribution of political power affects political institutions, which in turn affect economic institutions, which affects a nation’s ability to sustain economic growth.</p>
</div>
<div id="strongly-recommended" class="section level2">
<h2>Strongly Recommended</h2>
<ul>
<li><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Chapter 1 in Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012, <em>Why Nations Fail</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 1 sets the stage with a number of stories that emphasize the differences in inclusive vs. extractive institutions, primarily by comparing the colonization experience of the Spanish in South/Central America and the English in North America.</p>

<div id="questions-to-read-for" class="section level2">
<h2>Questions to Read For</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>What does Baumol mean that entrepreneurship can be “productive,” “unproductive,” or “destructive,” and what role do institutions play?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the problem with “finding the right people” to elect/appoint to govern a society?</p></li>
<li><p>Related to the previous question, how do the knowledge and incentive problems affect how we govern society? What does a society that is <em>robust</em> to those problems mean, or look like?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the nirvana fallacy?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do people make different assumptions about how consumers make (selfish/irrational/foolish/etc) choices in a market economy, vs. the how (the same!) people make (wise/public-spirited) choices in politics (as voters, elected officials, dictators, etc)? What are the implications of assuming <em>the same</em> people are guided by self-interest in these different arenas?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the different between profit-seeking and rent-seeking? What role do institutions play in creating/changing the difference?</p></li>
<li><p>According to Acemoglu and Robinson, what is the difference between “inclusive” institutions and “extractive” institutions?</p></li>
<li><p>According to Acemoglu and Robinson, why is it <em>political</em> losers, rather than <em>economic</em> losers, that are more likely to block creative destruction and innovation?</p></li>
<li><p>Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson argue that a major cause of differences in GDP per capita today come from historical institutions, especially in former colonies, the type of colony that was set up hundreds of years ago — either inclusive or extractive. One of the primary factors determining <em>what type</em> of colony Europeans chose to set up was <em>disease</em> — is this geography affecting development (through institutions) all over again?</p></li>
