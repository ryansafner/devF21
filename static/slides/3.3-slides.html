&gt; "The conversation remained friendly, even though the tension between the two societies that Yali and I represented was familiar to both of us. Two centuries ago, all New Guineans were still "living in the Stone Age." That is, they still used stone tools similar to those superseded in Europe by metal tools thousands of years ago, and they dwelt in villages not organized under any centralized political authority. Whites had arrived, imposed centralized government, and brought material goods whose value New Guineans instantly recognized, ranging from steel axes, matches, and medicines to clothing, soft drinks, and umbrellas. In New Guinea all these goods were referred to collectively as "cargo," (p.14).

Column 2 replicates the estimates of column 1 using this restricted sample—the joint explanatory power of geographic variables rises to 55 percent, since the new sample excludes regions that are rich today as a result of the guns, germs, and steel of colonizing Europeans rather than purely geographic factors," (p.5).

&gt; While geographic factors may have continued to affect economic development after the introduction of agriculture, the availability of prehistoric domesticable wild plant and animal species did not influence population density in the past two millennia other than through the timing of the Neolithic transition...The results of column 3 (OLS) and column 4 (IV) of table 2 illustrate their findings: .hi[years since the agricultural transition has a strong, statistically significant positive effect on population density in 1500]...The magnitude of the effect is large, as a one standard deviation change in years of agriculture is associated with 63 percent of a standard deviation change in log population density in 1500 (OLS)..All of the other regressors feature much smaller standardized effects.

&gt; They show, not only that .hi[an earlier onset of the Neolithic transition contributed to the level of technological sophistication in the preindustrial world], but also that .hi[the effect of Diamond’s biogeographic factors may well operate through the legacy of an early exposure to agriculture]," (pp.7-8).

# Deep Roots, Tech. Adoption, &amp; Urbanization

.quitesmall[
&gt; “The main finding of this paper is a simple one. .hi[Technology in 1500 AD is associated with the wealth of nations today.] This is robust to including continent dummies and geographic controls, so .hi[it is not just driven by “Europe versus Africa” or “ tropical versus temperate zones.”] There are two notable parts of the finding. The first is that technology as old as 1500 AD is a historical correlate of development when we consider that .hi[most historical discussions of developing countries start with post-1500 European contact and colonization.] The second notable aspect of our finding is that .hi[the magnitude of the association between historical technology adoption and current development is nontrivial.] In our baseline specification for migration-adjusted technology, going from having none to .hi[having adopted all the technologies available in 1500 AD is associated with an increase in current per capita GDP by a factor of 26.] More realistically, after including a battery of controls, this multiple is still between 5.9 and 13.3.”

&gt; “In an effort toward understanding what drives this correlation, we have found suggestive results that .hi[technology is very persistent, that this persistence is not driven only by the persistence of population,] and that it does not disappear when calculated only within sectors after removing the country average adoption level in the period and country-sector fixed effects (hence, controlling for any factors that operate at a country-wide level such as institutions). This evidence provides support to the hypothesis that the technology adoption dynamics, in which the cost of adopting new technology falls with the stock of previous technology, are one of the mechanisms that generates the propagation uncovered in the data,” (p.94).

This paper tests the .hi[hypothesis that the TseTse reduced the ability of Africans to generate an agricultural surplus historically.] .hi[Ethnic groups inhabiting TseTse-suitable areas were less likely to use domesticated animals and the plow, less likely to be politically centralized, and had a lower population density.] These correlations are not found in the tropics outside of Africa, where the fly does not exist. The evidence suggests current economic performance is affected by the TseTse through the channel of precolonial political centralization,” (p. 382).

&gt; “[T]he policy implications of these findings, if the findings are true, are staggering. Aid programs should be rethought, and the crucial issue of migration should be brought into much sharper focus.”

&gt; “The research agenda needs to be reshaped in light of the importance of geographic variables. We know precious little about the underlying relationships between climate and agricultural productivity, disease vectors, and public health. Not only do we not know the costs of malaria in terms of economic development but we barely know the quantitative extent of the disease. Cause-of-death data are not available for most developing countries and even fewer data are available on illness. We lack basic data on transport costs that are comparable across countries and, even more important, within countries between hinterlands and urban areas. By neglecting geographic variables, we may overstate the role of policy variables in economic growth and neglect some deeper obstacles (although, because policy variables are often so poorly measured in cross-country work, there is an inherent downward bias due to measurement errors),” (p.212).

&gt; “The twenty-eight landlocked countries outside Europe, containing 295 million people in 1995, are among the poorest in the world, with an average per capita income of $1,673. In many cases, the infrastructure linking these countries to world markets is seriously deficient. Coastal countries harass landlocked countries, neglect the road networks that would link them to the coast, or impose punitive effective taxation through transit and port charges. In some cases, heated political clashes have taken place between interior and coastal countries. Bolivia and Chile, for example, still lack diplomatic relations 119 years after the War of the Pacific cost Bolivia its coastline. Aid programs to improve transport infrastructure linking landlocked countries to ports almost necessarily require the cooperation of several countries,” (pp.213-214).

&gt; “Second, policy makers should examine the likelihood and desirability of large-scale future migrations from geographically disadvantaged regions. Suppose that sizable populations face local cost or disease conditions that prohibit economic growth. The result is likely to be growing pressures for mass migration, first within countries, then across national borders, and finally internationally,” (p.214).

&gt; “Finally, donors should reexamine the balance of aid between policy-based lending to individual governments—which is the most popular form—and greatly enhanced aid for basic research on tropical agriculture and tropical public health. Our results suggest that the tropics are damned not just, or even mainly, by bad policies but by difficult inherent conditions. If this is the case, the relentless focus on policy reform may be misguided. A more effective approach to controlling malaria might do more to improve the economic environment—and incidentally, might improve policy by enhancing the incentives for good policies facing the sovereign,” (p.215).
