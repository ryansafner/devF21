- **“Knife's Edge” equilibrium**: a single savings rate and ICOR that permits stable growth

> “To sum up, Domar's model was not intended as a growth model, made no sense as a growth model, and was repudiated as a growth model. So it was ironic that Domar's growth model became, and continues to be today, the most widely applied growth model in economic history,” (p.28).
