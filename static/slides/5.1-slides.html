# The Economics of Sharecropping I

- One extreme solution:

- Farmer pays a fixed fee up front, once paid, the farmer keeps all surplus

- Would have to be high enough to be worthwhile to the landlord

- Problems with this solution:
  1. requires high upfront cost to farmer (often poor, capital-constrained)
  2. imposes the entirety of the risk on the farmer (bad harvest, weather, invasion, theft)

- New .hi-purple[principle-agent problems] introduced:

1. Farmer has an incentive to *underreport* to landlord how much surplus they produce, effectively "stealing" more than their share
  - landowner must monitor farmer to reduce this possibility (and this is costly)

2. Farmer is effectively taxed (50%, in this example) on their output
  - has 50% less incentive to be productive than if they were 100% residual claimant
  - farmer will exert less effort since they get less of the output

&gt; “A good part of the .hi[politics of measurement] sprang from what a contemporary economist might call .hi[the "stickiness" of feudal rents.] Noble and clerical claimants often found it .hi[difficult to increase feudal dues directly]; the levels set for various charges were the .hi[result of long struggle,] and even a small increase above the customary level was viewed as a .hi[threatening breach of tradition.] Adjusting the measure, however, represented a roundabout way of achieving the same end.”

&gt; “The local lord might, for example, lend grain to peasants in smaller baskets and insist on repayment in larger baskets. He might surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the grain sacks accepted for milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of the sacks used for measuring out flour; he might also collect feudal dues in larger baskets and pay wages in kind in smaller baskets. While the formal custom governing feudal dues and wages would thus remain intact (requiring, for example, the same number of sacks of wheat from the harvest of a given holding), the actual transaction might increasingly favor the lord. The results of such fiddling were far from trivial. Kula estimates that the size of the bushel (boisseau) used to collect the main feudal rent (taille) increased by one-third between 1674 and 1716 as part of what was called the reaction feodale.”

&gt; "We argue that the effect of economic change on political power is a key factor in determining whether technological advances and beneficial economic changes will be blocked. In other words, we propose a "political-loser hypothesis." We argue that it is groups whose political power (not economic rents) is eroded who will block technological advances. If agents are economic losers but have no political power, they cannot impede technological progress. If they have and maintain political power (i.e., are not political losers), then they have no incentive to block progress. It is therefore agents who have political power and fear losing it who will have incentives to block. Our analysis suggests that we should look more to the nature of political institutions and the determinants of the distribution of political power if we want to understand technological backwardness," (pp.126-127).

# Monarchs are Often Weak Relative to Other Elites I

.pull-left[

- Monarch *might* nominally rule all land in country (as in post-Conquest England) and grant fiefs to lords

- Often Monarch is just one ruler with his/her own land

- Barons, earls, dukes, etc. have their own realms and sources of power, nominally loyal to the monarch

- .hi[NWW's Proportionality principle]: for a stable political system, .hi-purple[rents must be allocated in proportion to groups' capacity for violence] 

- Rational elites will revolt if they believe their relative strength is greater than the rents they are earning
  - Other elites need to "buy off" their support or else risk revolt

- Dynamics: if distribution of wealth and power changes, the allocation of rents must change!

# Power and Personality

.pull-left[

- Elites are loyal to the king as a *person*, not as an office!

- Loyalty depends on king's ability to distribute booty and rents to elites

- "King" or "Warlord" does not control *territory*, controls *vassals* based on social networks and bundle of privileges

# Monarch's Role as Head of Patronage Networks I

.pull-left[
- Monarch is head of many patronage networks, often from the most powerful/wealthiest family 

- Has siblings and many blood relations that expect patronage or else they might challenge claim to throne

- Monarch must redistribute as patronage (land, titles, marriages, inheritances) to loyal supporters to maintain support

# Monarch's Role as Head of Patronage Networks II

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- After 1066 conquest, William I the Conquerer claims *all* land in England

- Nobody owns land in their own right, all land is property of the King
  - Of course, King cannot govern entirety of land all the time
  - Nobles retain control over their domains, but nominally owned by King
  
- Monarchs often reclaim ("escheat") land from nobles who *break* fealty, commit treason, or die without heirs
  - redistribute to loyal elites as patronage
  - inheritance must be "bought" with "relief" (a fee) to the King

# Monarch's Power and Revenue Sources

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Rents from royal lands and forests

- Feudal dues owed from lords and knights (or scutage)

- Monarchs dispensed justice at royal courts (for fees)

- Borrow money (if monarch's credit was good - which was almost never)
  - frequent defaults, expropriation of creditors, expulsions of Jews

- *Some* taxes that could collect *some* revenue

# Monarch's Weakness Relative to Nobles

.pull-left[
- Medieval warfare is primarily siege and countersiege

- Few pitched battles

- Warfare *favors the defender*

- Very easy for rebellious lords to raise their banners, sit in their castles, and outlast the King's army (or vice versa)

- Pre-artillery, pre-gunpowder

.pull-right[

- Most peasants not freeholders - tied to the land of their lord

- A two-way feudal obligation: peasants must stay and work for lord, but lord has a duty to protect peasant; cannot evict or replace peasant without legal cause

- Illegal for peasants to leave one manor for another (or a town), but lords unable to extradite

- Vagrancy laws, suspicion of outsiders and foreigners, the "undeserving poor"

.pull-right[

- Peasants outnumber king and lords `\(&gt;20:1\)`, why not revolt?

- Mass revolution is a collective action problem
  - Public benefits (individual shares small fraction), *very* large private cost (risk of a gruesome death)

- Very high coordination costs: peasant "class" is scattered across thousands of manors (their whole social world), different families, tribes, etc.

- General peasant revolts do happen a few times
  - Response to changing economic conditions (see below)
  - Even if you win, what do you do then??

- .hi["Commercial Revolution"] of 1100s-1200s

- *International* merchants can't depend on weak and biased States to enforce *international* contracts!

- Merchants adopted their own "laws" and best practices to minimize transaction costs

- For-profit merchant courts emerge to settle disputes and enforce international contracts
  - More efficient, cheaper, and less partisan than Royal courts
  - Legal and jurisdictional competition

- Developed contract law and advanced legal instruments - debt, credit, loans, equity contracts

- This is a major basis of international commercial law today!
