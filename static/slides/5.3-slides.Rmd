- How did some countries transition further to .hi-purple[open-access orders] or .hi-purple[liberal democracies]?

- Great Reform Acts were in the interest of intra-elite bargaining amidst a natural state

- Elite continues to expand definition of who counts as elite and deserving of rights

- Unintended consequences:
  - leads to competitive elections, mass political parties, participatory democracy
  - Selectorate (and winning coalition) expands: need more public goods and less private rents for political support!

- Slavery Abolition Act (1833)

- Further Reform Acts in 1867, 1884, 1918, 1928
  - extend franchise to working class, counties (instead of just towns), all men, then all women

> "[Repealing the Corn laws would solve four problems.] First, it would guarantee the prosperity of the manufacturer by affording him outlets for his products. Second, it would relieve the Condition of England question by cheapening the price of food and ensuring more regular employment. Third, it would make English agriculture more efficient by stimulating demand for its products in urban and industrial areas. Fourth, it would introduce through mutually advantageous international trade a new era of international fellowship and peace. The only barrier to these four beneficent solutions was the ignorant self-interest of the landlords, the "bread-taxing oligarchy, unprincipled, unfeeling, rapacious and plundering."
