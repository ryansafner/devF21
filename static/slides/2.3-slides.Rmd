He must then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent of land.” (Book I, Chapter 11).

# An Aggregate Production Function: Implications

Under constant returns:

- If two countries have the same technology, there is no economic advantage to size

- Labor productivity $\left(\frac{Y}{L}\right)$, output-per-worker/hour, is determined only by $\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)$, capital-per-worker/hour

$$Y = MP_LL + MP_KK + MP_T T$$

- With competitive markets, firms pay each factor its marginal product, firms earn no profits<sup>.red[1]</sup>

.footnote[<sup>.red[1]</sup> This is also called the "product exhaustion theorem," and comes from [Euler's Theorem for homogeneous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function#Positive_homogeneity) (constant returns functions are homogeneous of degree 1).]
