If a socialist community were capable of economic calculation, it could be set up without any change in men's moral character," (p. 407).

- `\(\implies\)` no exchange of capital goods

- `\(\implies\)` no market prices for capital goods

- `\(\implies\)` no profit or loss signals

- `\(\implies\)` no feedback to determine if an allocation is efficient

- Therefore, .hi-purple[it is impossible under socialism to rationally allocate productive resources]

&gt; "Where there is no free market, there is no pricing mechanism; without a pricing mechanism, there is no economic calculation," (p. 18)

How will it be able to decide whether this or that method of production is the more profitable?"

- Socialists claim we can run the economy like we run a firm

- This mistakes the .hi[economic problem] for a mere .hi-purple[technological problem]

- Capital and production is not a mere problem of management and allocating resources (assuming a static, constant structure of the economy)

- The real problem is *dynamic* and *entrepreneurial*! Activities in the capital market (starting firms, merging them, dissolving them, lending, borrowing, exchanging equity, credit) *change the structure* of the economy!

&gt; "The cardinal fallacy implied in this and all kindred proposals is that they...consider the structure of industrial production and the allocation of capital to the various branches and production aggregates as rigid, and do not take into account the necessity of altering this structure in order to adjust it to changes in conditions...The operations of managers, their buying and selling, are only a small segment of the totality of market operations...The entrepreneurs and capitalists establish corporations and other firms, enlarge or reduce their size, dissolve them or merge them with other enterprises; they buy and sell the shares of bonds of already existing and of new corporations; they grant, withdraw, and recover credits; in short they perform all those acts the totality of which is called the capital and money market," (p.703).

&gt; "Our problem does not refer to the managerial activities; it concerns the allocation of capital to the various branches of industry. The question is: In which branches should production be increased or restricted, in which branches should the objective of production be altered, what new branches should be inaugurated? With regard to these issues it is vain to cite the honest corporation manager and his well-tried efficiency. Those who confused entrepreneurship and management close their eyes to the economic problem...The capitalist system is not a managerial system, it is an entrepreneurial system," (p.703).

&gt; "[It was Mises'] powerful challenge that forced the socialists to recognize the importance of an adequate system of economic accounting to guide the allocation of resources in a socialist economy. Even more, it was chiefly due to Professor Mises' challenge that many socialists became aware of the very existence of such a problem," (p.53).

&gt; "Professor Mises' contention that a socialist economy cannot solve the problem of rational allocation of resources is based on a confusion concerning the nature of prices...[Prices are merely trade-off ratios, the] terms on which alternatives are offered," (p.54).

The administrators of a socialist economy will have exactly the same knowledge, or lack of knowledge, of the production functions as the capitalist entrepreneurs have.," (p.55).

- "Market socialism" is superior for 4 reasons:

1. It can redistribute endowments, namely toward greater equality, “so as to attain the maximum social welfare."
2. It can modify prices to correct for external effects 
3. eliminate monopoly pricing, in both ways approaching the ideal of perfect competition more closely than a market economy
4. Socialism is better able to foster technological progress

&gt; "If socialism is to be identified with the belief that the abolition of private property would automatically establish the brotherhood of man - and many socialists did, while some apparently still do - then socialism must be counted out as false," (vii).

&gt; "**Economics of Control** [takes the stress away] from collectivism and applied to the idea of conscious recognition of the problems of social organization and the exercise of conscious control over the economic system...The economics of *control* is still contrasted with the economics of *laissez fare*, but control does not necessarily mean collectivism. **It suggests the deliberate application of whatever policy will best serve the social interest**, without prejudging the issue between collective ownership and administration or some form of private enterprise," (vii-viii).

# The Socialist Calculation Debate In Retrospect I

.pull-left[
- Overall, the socialist calculation "debate" largely ended with **economists talking past each other**
    - Both sides walked away believing they had "won"

- Mises &amp; Hayek (["The Austrians"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School)) begin to recognize that they view "prices," "equilibrium," "competition," and "efficiency" *very differently* than neoclassical economists

# The Socialist Calculation Debate In Retrospect II

.smaller[
Stages of the debate:

1. Marxists argue for moneyless, propertyless, centrally-planned economy as a superior system for achieving coordinated, "advanced material production" as compared to the ``anarchy'' of capitalist production
2. Mises (1920) argued that socialism cannot achieve its defined goals due to its inability to solve the economic calculation problem
3. Developments in NC-GE theory show logical/formal similarity of systems of equations between the socialist and capitalist system under static, ideal, conditions
4. Hayek extends Mises' calculation point as a problem of dispersed tacit knowledge (impossible to achieve via equation-solving) that is not *given* to any agent or system; competition and market prices enable *discovery* of optimal resource uses 
5. Lange &amp; others argue "market socialism" can approximate *perfect competition*

- Main disagreement is about **rivalry**

- **Marxists**: .hi-purple[rivalry as inherent flaw] in capitalism leading to conflict; central planning removes rivalry and leads to pre-coordinated harmony

- **Mises-Hayek**: .hi-purple[rivalry] under specific institutions (market prices, property rights) .hi-purple[is the only way to generate the information] necessary to rationally allocate resources

- **Neoclassical economists**: .hi-purple[assume rivalry away] in perfect competition models, viewing prices as just parametric statistics, allowing a central planner to achieve the same optimal outcome
